# Hi 👋, I'm Ivarovskiy. Welcome to my Angular Screening.

The following technologies were used in the development:

### Created additional possibility of introducing rules from the outside

## 📝 I created my own layout and tried to display how I see a beautiful and convenient application, and I hope you like it

# To run the application locally, copy the repository address and use the console to enter the command 
- ## git clone (url)
# After that, go to the folder with the copied project and enter the command 
- ## npm install
# After successfully installing the packages, enter the -## ng serve command in the terminal of the VS Code application

## Thanks for your attention! 🤝
